      A <strong>401(k) to Gold IRA rollover</strong> can be a way to diversify retirement savings into physical precious metals
      held inside a self-directed IRA. This guide covers eligibility, step-by-step rollover options, costs, and common mistakes.
    </p>

    <div class="note" style="margin-top:12px">
      <strong>Quick take:</strong> Most successful rollovers are <strong>direct (custodian-to-custodian)</strong>.
      The biggest reason people run into trouble is eligibility (current employer plans) and misunderstanding fees.

  <!-- ELIGIBILITY (DIFFERENTIATOR) -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Are you eligible to roll a 401(k) into a Gold IRA?</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      In many cases, yes but eligibility depends on your <strong>employment status</strong> and your plan’s rules.
      Most rollovers happen after leaving an employer (job change, retirement).
      Some plans allow <em>in-service</em> rollovers, but it varies by administrator.
    </p>

    <h3>Fast eligibility checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Former employer 401(k):</strong> often eligible for a rollover.</li>
      <li><strong>Current employer 401(k):</strong> may be restricted unless your plan allows in-service rollovers.</li>
      <li><strong>Age matters:</strong> some plans only allow certain rollovers after <strong>59½</strong> (plan rules vary).</li>
      <li><strong>Ask this directly:</strong> “Do you allow a <em>direct rollover</em> to a self-directed IRA custodian?”</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note" style="margin-top:12px">

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP) -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>How a 401(k) to Gold IRA rollover works (step-by-step)</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Confirm eligibility</strong> with your 401(k) plan administrator (current vs former employer rules).</li>
      <li><strong>Open a self-directed Gold IRA</strong> with an approved custodian (paperwork + account setup).</li>
      <li><strong>Choose the rollover method</strong> (direct rollover is usually preferred).</li>
      <li><strong>Move funds</strong> from the 401(k) to the new IRA (custodian-to-custodian transfer if possible).</li>
      <li><strong>Select IRS-approved metals</strong> through your custodian’s process.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage</strong> is handled via an approved depository (not personal storage).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Direct vs indirect rollover (what most people misunderstand)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Direct rollover:</strong> funds move directly between custodians. Lower risk of mistakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Indirect rollover:</strong> funds are distributed to you first, then re-deposited. Higher risk if timing rules are missed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      If your plan offers a direct rollover, it’s usually the cleanest path operationally.

  <!-- RULES -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Key Gold IRA rollover rules to know</h2>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Custody & storage:</strong> IRA metals must be held by an approved custodian and stored appropriately.</li>
      <li><strong>Distributions:</strong> standard IRA distribution rules still apply.</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> keep records of rollover type, dates, and confirmations from administrators.</li>
